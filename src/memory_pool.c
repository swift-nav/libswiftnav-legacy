 * The functional memory pool container is both a memory pool handling

 * such as map and fold that operate over the container. Elements can be

 * Allocation and deallocation from the pool are guaranteed constant time and

 *
 * 2. Next each group is iterated over by an aggregation function which reduces
 *    the whole group to exactly one new element that will be in the collection
 *    after reduction. The aggregation function is similar to a fold function.
 *
 *    The aggregation function is called once for each element of the group and
 *    passed a pointer to the new element that is the aggregate of all elements
 *    in the group. The new element is initialized as being a copy of the first
 *    element of the group but should be updated in-place by the aggregation
 *    function. The aggregation function is also passed a variable `n` which
 *    indicated which element of the group is being passed and the current
 *    group element is passed as parameter `elem`.
 *
 *    The aggregation function also takes an arbitrary argument `x` which is
 *    reset to `x0` at the start of processing each group by copying `x0` into
 *    a working area each time.
 *
 * \param pool Pointer to a memory pool
 * \param arg Arbitrary argument passed through to the comparison function
 * \param cmp Comparison function used to define the grouping
 * \param x0 Arbitrary argument passed to the aggregation function, reset to

 * pointer to the old element `elem`.

 * As a convenience the product function is also supplied with the total numer
