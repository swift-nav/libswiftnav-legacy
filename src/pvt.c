/** This function is the key to GPS solution, so it's commented
 * liberally.  It does a single step of a multi-dimensional
 * Newton-Raphson solution for the variables X, Y, Z (in ECEF) plus
 * the clock offset for each receiver used to make pseudorange
 * measurements.  The steps involved are roughly the following:
 *
 *     1. Account for the Earth's rotation during transmission
 *
 *     2. Estimate the ECEF position for each satellite measured using
 *     the downloaded ephemeris
 *
 *     3. Compute the Jacobian of pseudorange versus estimated state.
 *     There's no explicit differentiation; it's done symbolically
 *     first and just coded as a "line of sight" vector.
 *
 *     4. Get the inverse of the Jacobian times its transpose.  This
 *     matrix is normalized to one, but it tells us the direction we
 *     must move the state estimate during this step.
 *
 *     5. Multiply this inverse matrix (H) by the transpose of the
 *     Jacobian (to yield X).  This maps the direction of our state
 *     error into a direction of pseudorange error.
 *
 *     6. Multiply this matrix (X) by the error between the estimated
 *     (ephemeris) position and the measured pseudoranges.  This
 *     yields a vector of corrections to our state estimate.  We apply
 *     these to our current estimate and recurse to the next step.
 *
 *     7. If our corrections are very small, we've arrived at a good
 *     enough solution.  Solve for the receiver's velocity (with
 *     vel_solve) and do some bookkeeping to pass the solution back
 *     out.
