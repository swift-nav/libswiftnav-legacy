master: [![Build status][1]][2]

Libswiftnav is a platform independent library that implements GNSS functions
and algorithms for use by software-defined GNSS receivers or software requiring
GNNS functionality. It is intended to be as portable as possible 
and is written in standards compliant C with no dependancies other than the 
standard C libraries.

 Libswiftnav does not provide any functionality for communicating with
Swift Navigation receivers.  See [libsbp](https://github.com/swift-nav/libsbp) to communicate with receivers using Swift Binary Protocol (SBP).
