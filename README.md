Libswiftnav is a platform independent library that implements GNSS functions
and algorithms for use by software-defined GNSS receivers or software requiring
GNNS functionality. It is intended to be as portable as possible
and is written in standards compliant C with no dependancies other than the
standard C libraries.

Libswiftnav does not provide any functionality for communicating with Swift
Navigation receivers.  See [libsbp](https://github.com/swift-nav/libsbp) to
communicate with receivers using Swift Binary Protocol (SBP).
